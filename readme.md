In the context of the 2022 iGEM competition, and as part of the Starchlight project, I modeled the main phenomena underlying a special kind of bacterial fuel cell. The model was then tuned according to experimental data we gathered in the lab to predict the output of an industrial-scale device. The simulation also allowed us to further identify the main bottlenecks of a large-scale device.

Modify **params.py** to change the simulation's parameters.  
Modify **molecules.py** to alter the particle interactions.
Run **StarchLight_Simulator.py** to run the simulation.
